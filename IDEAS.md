# Theme: That's a LOT of entities!
(why did they vote for *that* ??)

## Setting
You're an exorcist of sorts and your job is to "manage" outbreaks of demonic 'entites'.
The game begins when you arrive at an incident and find that your shenaniganometer is off the charts.

That's a *lot* of entities!

## Gameplay
- Top-down twin-stick movement
- Increasingly dangerous waves of 'entities'
- Collecting single-use abilities from slain enemies
- Click to use the next ability in the queue (or punch if it's empty)
