**Survive a horde of ghoulish Entities by stealing their power!**

Controls:
- WASD or arrow keys to move around
- Use the cursor to aim
- Click to use the next Spark in your queue
  (or to punch if you don't have any)

Whenever you kill an Entity you gain its Spark, each spark can be used to perform a special action.
